# BabyCriesDiscomfortPain
Python, R Code and Data for Corvin et al.

This repository contains the jupyter notebooks (Python) and the R code that was used in the analysis and figure generation of the manuscript entitled: "Pain cues override identity cues in baby cries" by Corvin et al.

The jupyter notebooks are found in the folder BabyCries and are numbered in the order with wich they should be run. These notebooks rely on the custom code from the Theunissen lab that extracts acoustical features from sounds (in wav format) and performs various types of signal processing and statistical analyses. That code can be found in the public repository soundsig.  The release version soundsig v2.1 with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7909177 has the version of the code used in Corvin et al.
The R code is found in folder RCode and contains the code that performs the regularized mixed-effect statistical modeling used to analyze the psychoacoustical data.
The sound files and the data from human subjects are found in the folder OpenData.

Questions should be addressed to Siloé Corvin (siloe.corvin@etu.univ-lyon1.fr), Nicolas Mathevon (mathevon@univ-st-etienne.fr), or Frédéric Theunissen (theunissen@berkeley.edu)
